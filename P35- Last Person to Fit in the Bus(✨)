        sum(weight) over (
            order by turn
        ) as ws
        from queue
        order by turn
    )
    where ws <=1000
)
where rn = 1



Optimal Solution:-
SELECT person_name from
(

        sum(weight) over (
            order by turn
        ) as sum_weight
        from queue
        order by sum_weight desc
) where sum_weight <=1000 and rownum = 1
