Solution:-

My solution:-
Select p.product_id,nvl(round(sum(p.price*us.units)/sum(us.units),2),0) as average_price from prices p
left join unitsSold us
on p.product_id = us.product_id
and us.purchase_date >= p.start_date and us.purchase_date <= p.end_date
group by p.product_id;


Optimal Solution:-
Select p.product_id,coalesce(round(sum(p.price*us.units)/sum(us.units),2),0) as average_price from prices p
left join unitsSold us
on p.product_id = us.product_id
and us.purchase_date between p.start_date and p.end_date
group by p.product_id;
