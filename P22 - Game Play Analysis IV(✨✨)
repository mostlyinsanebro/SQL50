My Solution:-
WITH cte as
(
select count(*) as c from activity a1,
activity a2
where a1.player_id = a2.player_id
and to_char(a1.event_date+1,'yyyy-mm-dd') = to_char(a2.event_date,'yyyy-mm-dd')
and a1.event_date = (Select min(event_date) from activity where player_id = a1.player_id
                     group by player_id)
)
Select round(c/(Select count(distinct player_id) from activity),2) as fraction from cte



Optimal Solution:- using case
Select round(sum(
    case when 
    (Select min(event_date) from activity where player_id = a1.player_id)+1 = a1.event_date
    then 1
    else 0
    end
)/count(distinct player_id),2) as fraction
from activity a1
