Solution:-
Select customer_id  from customer c,
product p
where c.product_key = p.product_key
group by customer_id
having count(distinct p.product_key) = (select count(product_key) from product);


Alternate Solution:-
WITH total_products as
(select count(product_key) as total from product)


SELECT customer_id
from customer
group by customer_id
having count(distinct product_key) = (select max(total) from total_products);

-- The WITH clause is basically used to create a temporary table from a query or subquery which can then be used in the original
-- query.
