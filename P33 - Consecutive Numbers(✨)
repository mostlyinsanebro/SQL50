Solution:-
SELECT distinct num as ConsecutiveNums 
from logs l
where num = (select num from logs where id = l.id+1)
and num = (select num from logs where id = l.id-1);


Optimal Solution:- (Revise)
select distinct num as ConsecutiveNums from (
select num,id-rval as dat
from(
select id,
num,
row_number() over(partition by num order by id) rval
from logs))
group by num, dat
having count(*)>=3;
