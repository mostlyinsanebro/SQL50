Solution:-
WITH delivery_first_order as (
Select customer_id,
rank() over (partition by customer_id order by order_date) as rn,
case when  ORDER_DATE  = CUSTOMER_PREF_DELIVERY_DATE then 1 else 0 end order_immediate
from delivery d)

select round(sum(order_immediate)/count(distinct customer_id)*100,2) as  immediate_percentage
from
delivery_first_order 
where rn=1;


Alternate Brute Force Solution:-
SELECT round((sum(per)/count(*))*100,2) as immediate_percentage  from
(Select d.customer_id,
sum(case when d.order_date = d.CUSTOMER_PREF_DELIVERY_DATE then 1
else 0
end)/count(*) as per
from delivery d,
(SELECT customer_id,min(order_date) as mind
from delivery
group by customer_id) a
where d.customer_id = a.customer_id
and d.order_date = a.mind
group by d.customer_id)
