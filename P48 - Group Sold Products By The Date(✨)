LISTAGG FUNCTION:-
The LISTAGG function in Oracle is used to aggregate strings from multiple rows into a single string. From Oracle 19c onwards, the DISTINCT keyword can be used within the LISTAGG function to remove duplicates from the result.

Example

SELECT deptno, LISTAGG(DISTINCT ename, ', ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ename) AS employees
FROM emp
GROUP BY deptno
ORDER BY deptno;


Solution:-
Select to_char(a.sell_date,'yyyy-mm-dd') as sell_date,count(a.product) as num_sold,
listagg(a.product,',') within group (order by a.product) products
from (select distinct * from activities) a
group by a.sell_date
order by a.sell_date;
