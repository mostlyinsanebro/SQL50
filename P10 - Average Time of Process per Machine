Solution:-
Select machine_id,round((sum(diff)/count(machine_id)),3) as processing_time from
(Select a.machine_id,a. activity_type,a.timestamp,(b.timestamp-a.timestamp) as diff
from activity a,
activity b
where a.machine_id = b.machine_id
and a.process_id = b.process_id
and a.activity_type!=b.activity_type
and a.activity_type = 'start')
group by machine_id;
