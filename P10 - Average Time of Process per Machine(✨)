https://leetcode.com/problems/average-time-of-process-per-machine/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50


Solution:-
Select machine_id,round((sum(diff)/count(machine_id)),3) as processing_time from
(Select a.machine_id,a. activity_type,a.timestamp,(b.timestamp-a.timestamp) as diff
from activity a,
activity b
where a.machine_id = b.machine_id
and a.process_id = b.process_id
and a.activity_type!=b.activity_type
and a.activity_type = 'start')
group by machine_id;



Alternate Solution:-
SELECT machine_id,
round(sum(case activity_type
when 'start' then -timestamp
else timestamp
end)/(count(machine_id)/2),3) as processing_time
from activity
group by machine_id;


Simple solution:-
SELECT a1.machine_id, round(sum(a1.timestamp - a2.timestamp)/count(a1.process_id),3) as processing_time 
from activity a1,
activity a2
where a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id
and a1.process_id = a2.process_id
and a1.activity_type = 'end'
and a2.activity_type = 'start'
group by a1.machine_id
