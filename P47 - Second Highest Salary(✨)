Solution:-
SELECT max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
from employee
where salary < 
(select max(salary) from employee)



Alternate Solution:-
WITH cte as
(SELECT distinct salary,
dense_rank() over (order by salary desc) as rn
from employee)
SELECT
(
SELECT 
salary
from cte
where rn = 2
) as SecondHighestSalary
from dual;


The RANK() and DENSE_RANK() functions are essential tools in SQL Server for assigning rankings to rows in a dataset based on specified criteria.
RANK() functions assign a unique rank to each distinct row in the result set, with tied rows receiving the same rank and leaving gaps in subsequent ranks.
For example, if two rows tie for first place, the next row will receive a rank of 3.

On the other hand, DENSE_RANK() also assigns ranks based on criteria, but it does not leave gaps between ranks in case of tied rows. This means that if there are ties,
the next rank will not skip any numbers.
