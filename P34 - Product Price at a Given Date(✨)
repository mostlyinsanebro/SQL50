Approach:- First, we took all the rows where change_date < '2019-08-16' and found the max from it. This will find the next smaller date to '2019-08-16', which means the new_price
at that date will be our price. For ids having min(change_date) > '2019-08-16', we will take 10 as the default price.

Solution:-
select product_id,new_price as price
from products
where (product_id,change_date) in 
(select product_id,max(change_date)
from products
where change_date<='2019-08-16'
group by product_id)
union
select product_id,10 as price
from products
group by product_id
having min(change_date) > '2019-08-16'
order by product_id;
